## ❓ Why? [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
The goal of this project was to learn the basics of ReactJS. This project was a big project : a cryptocurrency visualizer. In this page, we can see :
- How many cryptocurrencies exist ?
- Number of markets
- Global color chart
- List of all cryptocurrency (we can sort by category)
- Specific graph for each cryptocurrency

(old project from school 2021)

## ✨ Tech stack [🔝](#-table-of-contents)
For this project, I used [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for default package management for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment from Node.js and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) the open-source JavaScript library used to facilitate the creation of single-page web applications, via the creation of components that depend on a state and generate an HTML page at each state change..
